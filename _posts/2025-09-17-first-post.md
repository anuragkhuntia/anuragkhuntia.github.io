title: "Automating Bare Metal with Terraform & MAAS"

Provisioning servers manually is slow and error-prone.  
In this post, Iâ€™ll share how I automated **bare metal provisioning** using:

- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- MAAS (Metal-as-a-Service) for managing hardware
- Ansible for configuration management

The result: **70% faster deployments** for UPI and IMPS workloads.
